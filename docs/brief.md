# Project Brief: Peptide Tracker App

## Executive Summary

**Product Concept:** A web-based peptide tracking application (with PWA capabilities) built in partnership with peptide expert Jay Campbell, focusing first on being the best peptide tracker, then expanding to AI-powered optimization insights.

**Primary Problem:** Existing health tracking apps are generic and inadequate for peptide users who need specialized tracking for injection sites, dosing protocols, cycling schedules, and side effects, with no AI-powered insights to optimize their protocols.

**Target Market:** Jay Campbell's engaged peptide community (~100K+ followers), advanced biohackers using Cronometer/MyFitnessPal, and "peptide curious" newcomers seeking expert guidance.

**Key Value Proposition:** The best peptide tracker built by peptide experts, featuring precise injection logging, dosage tracking with weekly monitoring, and comprehensive injection history with Jay Campbell's credibility for instant market penetration.

## Problem Statement

**Current State & Pain Points:**
- Peptide users currently track using inadequate tools: spreadsheets, basic health apps, or simple notes
- Generic health apps like MyFitnessPal lack peptide-specific features (injection sites, cycling protocols, stacking)
- No apps provide AI-powered insights for peptide data optimization
- Users struggle to correlate peptide effects with other health metrics
- Lack of expert guidance leads to suboptimal protocols and potential safety issues

**Impact of the Problem:**
- Suboptimal peptide protocols reduce effectiveness and waste money ($200-500/month investment)
- Poor tracking leads to safety issues and side effects
- Users abandon peptide therapy due to complexity and lack of guidance
- Growing peptide market (estimated $1B+) has massive tracking/optimization gap

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- MyFitnessPal: Generic nutrition focus, no injection tracking, no expert content
- Cronometer: Nutrition precision but no peptide expertise or community
- Medical apps: Compliance-focused, not optimization-oriented
- No competitor offers AI-powered insights for peptide data

**Urgency:** Peptide therapy is rapidly gaining mainstream adoption, creating first-mover advantage opportunity for expert-backed solution.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept:**
A purpose-built web-based peptide tracking application featuring exceptional injection logging (peptide selection, dosing schedules, injection tracking with notes), weekly dose monitoring to ensure users stay on track with their protocols, and comprehensive filterable injection history.

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **Expert Credibility:** Jay Campbell partnership provides instant trust and distribution
2. **Best-in-Class Tracking:** Superior peptide injection logging with comprehensive dose monitoring
3. **Weekly Dose Management:** Track progress against weekly/daily dose targets (e.g., 2mg Semaglutide weekly)
4. **Peptide Specialization:** Purpose-built for peptide protocols with comprehensive injection history and filtering

**Why This Solution Will Succeed:**
- Solves distribution problem through Jay Campbell's engaged audience
- Creates technical moat through AI capabilities no competitor offers
- Addresses real user pain points with specialized, expert-backed features
- Leverages growing peptide market momentum with first-mover advantage

**High-Level Product Vision:**
"The Strava for peptides" - combining expert guidance, community features, and cutting-edge AI to create the definitive peptide optimization platform.
