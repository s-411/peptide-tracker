# Story 3.4: Protocol Analytics and Insights

**Status:** Ready for Review
**Epic:** Epic 3 - Weekly Dose Monitoring & Progress Tracking
**Agent Model Used:** Claude-4 Sonnet

## Story

As a peptide user,
I want to see analytics about my protocol adherence and patterns,
so that I can optimize my peptide use, identify trends, and share comprehensive reports with healthcare providers.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Protocols table, injections table, dashboard analytics section
- Technology: Next.js with data visualization libraries (Chart.js/Recharts), Supabase analytics queries
- Follows pattern: Existing dashboard pattern, new analytics section
- Touch points: Historical injection data, protocol configurations, export functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Protocol Adherence Analytics**
   - Calculate and display protocol adherence percentage over configurable time periods
   - Show consistency trends with visual charts (daily, weekly, monthly views)
   - Identify patterns of missed doses and adherence streaks
   - Compare adherence across different peptides and protocols

2. **Injection Site Analysis**
   - Rotation analysis showing distribution of injection sites used
   - Identify overused or underused injection sites
   - Visual site rotation map with frequency indicators
   - Recommendations for better rotation practices

3. **Timing Pattern Analysis**
   - Analyze injection timing patterns to identify optimal windows
   - Show consistency of injection times throughout the day/week
   - Identify timing trends that correlate with better adherence
   - Suggest optimal injection scheduling based on historical patterns

4. **Dose Variance Tracking**
   - Track dose consistency and variance from protocol targets
   - Identify patterns of dose deviation (consistently high/low)
   - Show dose accuracy trends over time
   - Alert on significant dose variance issues

**Reporting and Export:**

5. **Comprehensive Reports**
   - Weekly summary reports with key metrics and insights
   - Monthly protocol performance summaries
   - Customizable date range reporting
   - Visual dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs)

6. **Healthcare Provider Integration**
   - Exportable PDF reports suitable for medical consultation
   - CSV data export for external analysis
   - Printable summary reports with charts and key metrics
   - Anonymizable data export options

7. **Comparative Analytics**
   - Month-over-month comparison of protocol compliance
   - Before/after protocol change analysis
   - Multi-protocol comparison for users on multiple peptides
   - Goal vs. actual performance tracking

**Quality Requirements:**

8. **Data Accuracy**
   - Precise calculation of all metrics with validation
   - Handle edge cases (incomplete weeks, protocol changes)
   - Accurate timezone handling for time-based analytics
   - Data integrity checks for analytics calculations

9. **Performance**
   - Fast analytics calculation with complex data aggregation
   - Efficient queries for large historical datasets
   - Responsive charts and visualizations
   - Optimized export generation

## Technical Notes

- **Analytics Engine:** Complex SQL queries with aggregations, potentially use Supabase views for performance
- **Integration Approach:** Create dedicated analytics section, integrate with existing dashboard structure
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow dashboard component patterns, create new analytics-specific components
- **Key Constraints:** Handle large datasets efficiently, maintain user privacy in exports, accurate statistical calculations

## Dev Notes

- Consider pre-calculated analytics tables/views for performance
- Analytics calculations should handle protocol changes mid-period
- Export functionality needs to be secure and respect user privacy settings
- Charts should be accessible and mobile-responsive
- Consider analytics caching strategy for frequently accessed reports

## Testing

- Test analytics accuracy with complex historical data scenarios
- Verify export functionality across different file formats
- Test performance with large injection history datasets
- Validate statistical calculations and edge case handling
- Test responsive design of charts and analytics components
