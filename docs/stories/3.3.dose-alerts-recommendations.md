# Story 3.3: Dose Alerts and Recommendations

**Status:** Ready for Review
**Epic:** Epic 3 - Weekly Dose Monitoring & Progress Tracking
**Agent Model Used:** Claude-4 Sonnet

## Story

As a peptide user,
I want to receive intelligent alerts about my dosing schedule,
so that I can avoid missed doses, stay within safe limits, and maintain optimal injection practices.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Protocols table, injections table, user preferences, notification system
- Technology: Next.js with notification APIs, Supabase edge functions, browser notifications
- Follows pattern: Existing notification patterns (if any), or establish new notification system
- Touch points: User settings, protocol tracking, injection logging, dashboard alerts

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Dose Limit Alerts**
   - Alert when approaching weekly dose limits (configurable threshold, default 90%)
   - Prevent overdose attempts with warning when trying to exceed protocol maximum
   - Visual indicators on injection logging form when approaching limits
   - Summary alert showing total weekly accumulated dose vs. target

2. **Missed Dose Notifications**
   - Smart detection of missed doses based on protocol schedule expectations
   - Gentle reminders when doses are overdue based on typical timing
   - Account for flexible schedules (every other day, specific days)
   - Grace period before marking doses as "missed" (configurable)

3. **Injection Site Rotation Reminders**
   - Track injection site usage frequency
   - Alert when same site used too frequently (configurable frequency)
   - Suggest alternative injection sites based on rotation best practices
   - Visual indicators showing recent site usage history

4. **Protocol Completion Notifications**
   - Celebration notification when weekly targets are successfully met
   - Progress milestone notifications (25%, 50%, 75% completion)
   - End-of-week summary showing adherence performance
   - Streak tracking for consistent protocol following

**Integration Requirements:**

5. **Alert Delivery System**
   - In-app notifications via dashboard and injection forms
   - Browser push notifications (with user permission)
   - Email notifications for critical safety alerts
   - Customizable notification preferences per alert type

6. **Smart Recommendation Engine**
   - Suggest optimal timing for remaining weekly doses
   - Recommend injection sites based on rotation principles
   - Provide protocol adjustment suggestions based on patterns
   - Context-aware recommendations based on user behavior

7. **User Preferences Integration**
   - Notification settings page integrated with user profile
   - Granular control over alert types and delivery methods
   - Quiet hours settings to avoid disruptive notifications
   - Custom threshold settings for dose limit alerts

**Quality Requirements:**

8. **Privacy and Security**
   - All notification data processed securely
   - User control over notification data retention
   - No sensitive dosing information in push notifications
   - Secure handling of notification tokens

9. **Performance**
   - Efficient background processing for alert calculation
   - Non-blocking notification delivery
   - Minimal impact on application performance

## Technical Notes

- **Alert Engine:** Implement using Supabase Edge Functions for background processing
- **Integration Approach:** Create notification service that integrates with existing components
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Build new notification system following Next.js best practices
- **Key Constraints:** Must respect user privacy, handle timezone considerations, graceful degradation if notifications disabled

## Dev Notes

- Consider using Web Push API for browser notifications
- Alert calculations should run on schedule (daily background job)
- Notification preferences should persist in user profile
- Integration with injection site tracking from existing injection data
- Consider notification batching to avoid spam

## Testing

- Test alert triggering with various protocol scenarios
- Verify notification delivery across different browsers and devices
- Test user preferences and opt-out functionality
- Validate dose limit calculations with edge cases
- Test injection site rotation logic with different usage patterns
