# Story 3.1: Dose Target Configuration

**Status:** Ready for Review
**Epic:** Epic 3 - Weekly Dose Monitoring & Progress Tracking
**Agent Model Used:** Claude-4 Sonnet

## Story

As a peptide user,
I want to set weekly and daily dose targets for my peptides,
so that I can track my adherence to prescribed or planned protocols and ensure I'm following safe dosing schedules.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing peptides table and user peptide library
- Technology: Next.js React components, Supabase database, TypeScript
- Follows pattern: Existing peptide management patterns in `/apps/web/src/components/peptides/`
- Touch points: Peptides table, new protocols table, user peptide selection

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Protocol Configuration Interface**
   - Create protocol setup page accessible from peptide management area
   - Allow users to select peptides from their library for protocol creation
   - Support multiple active protocols simultaneously for peptide stacking

2. **Dose Target Configuration**
   - Weekly dose target input with validation against peptide safety ranges
   - Daily dose target option for peptides used on daily schedules
   - Flexible scheduling: every other day, specific days of week (Mon, Wed, Fri, etc.)
   - Support for cycling protocols with defined start and end dates

3. **Protocol Templates**
   - Pre-configured protocol templates based on Jay Campbell's recommended schedules
   - Template selection with customization options
   - Save custom protocols as reusable templates for future use

**Integration Requirements:**

4. **Database Schema Enhancement**
   - Create `protocols` table linked to users and peptides
   - Store flexible scheduling rules and target configurations
   - Maintain referential integrity with existing peptides and users tables

5. **UI Integration**
   - Follow existing component patterns from peptides management
   - Consistent styling with current application design
   - Mobile-responsive protocol configuration interface

6. **Data Validation**
   - Validate dose targets against existing peptide `typical_dose_range` from database
   - Prevent overlapping conflicting protocols for the same peptide
   - Ensure start dates are not in the past and end dates are after start dates

**Quality Requirements:**

7. **Testing Coverage**
   - Unit tests for protocol validation logic
   - Integration tests for database operations
   - End-to-end tests for protocol creation flow

8. **Performance**
   - Fast protocol lookup and configuration updates
   - Efficient querying of active protocols for user dashboard

9. **Security**
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for protocols table
   - User isolation - users can only manage their own protocols

## Technical Notes

- **Database Schema:** Extend existing schema with `protocols` table containing: `id`, `user_id`, `peptide_id`, `weekly_target`, `daily_target`, `schedule_type`, `schedule_config`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `is_template`, `template_name`
- **Integration Approach:** Build on existing peptide selection patterns, integrate with current dashboard layout
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow component structure from `/apps/web/src/components/peptides/PeptideForm.tsx`
- **Key Constraints:** Must work with existing injection logging system, protocols must align with safety ranges in peptides table

## Dev Notes

- Reference existing peptide management components for UI patterns
- Protocol `schedule_config` should be JSONB to store flexible scheduling rules
- Consider protocol versioning for future protocol modification tracking
- Integration point: Dashboard will need to query active protocols for progress tracking

## Testing

- Test protocol creation with various scheduling options
- Verify dose validation against peptide safety ranges
- Test concurrent protocols (stacking) scenarios
- Validate database constraints and RLS policies
- Test protocol template functionality
