## Dev Notes

### Architecture References

**Authentication Service:** Clerk.com
- Complete auth solution with subscription billing
- Handles all authentication complexity including OAuth providers
- Manages user sessions, password reset, and security
- Integrates with subscription billing for premium features

**Security Requirements:**
- HIPAA-adjacent health data protection
- Secure user authentication and session management
- Token storage managed by Clerk (no manual JWT handling)
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies will be implemented at database level

**Integration Points:**
- User authentication data managed by Clerk.com
- Peptide tracking data stored in Supabase linked via Clerk user IDs
- Complete account isolation between users
- User preferences stored in application database linked to Clerk ID

**Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Clerk Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Frontend App URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Middleware Configuration:**
- Clerk middleware handles authentication for all routes
- Public routes: `/`, `/auth/*`, `/api/webhooks/*`
- Protected routes: All peptide tracking functionality
- API routes protected at tRPC level

**User Data Model Integration:**
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  clerkUserId: string;  // Links to Clerk user
  email: string;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
  subscriptionTier: SubscriptionTier;
}
```

**Route Structure:**
```
pages/
├── auth/
│   ├── sign-in.tsx
│   └── sign-up.tsx
├── dashboard.tsx          # Protected
├── quick-log.tsx          # Protected
└── api/
    └── webhooks/
        └── clerk.ts       # Webhook handler
```

**Component Architecture:**
- Use Clerk's pre-built components for consistency
- Wrap protected pages with authentication guards
- Implement user profile components for account management
- Create reusable authentication state hooks

### Testing

**Authentication Testing Strategy:**
- Test all authentication flows (register, login, logout, password reset)
- Verify protected route access control
- Test session management and persistence
- Validate user profile CRUD operations

**Test Scenarios:**
- Valid/invalid registration attempts
- Successful/failed login attempts
- Password reset flow validation
- Protected route access without authentication
- Session timeout and refresh scenarios
- User profile update operations

**Security Testing:**
- Verify no sensitive data exposed in client
- Test authentication state management
- Validate session security
- Check redirect behavior for unauthenticated access
