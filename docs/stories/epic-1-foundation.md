# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

## Epic Overview

Establish the foundational technical infrastructure including project setup, user authentication, database schema, and basic peptide management capabilities. This epic will deliver a working application with user registration, login, and the ability to manage a personal peptide library, providing the foundation for all subsequent tracking features.

## Epic Status: **STORIES CREATED** ✅

All Epic 1 stories have been created and are ready for development implementation.

## Epic Goals

- Establish project foundation with authentication, database setup, and basic peptide management
- Enable user accounts and initial peptide tracking capabilities
- Provide technical foundation for Epic 2-4 implementation
- Achieve MVP-ready infrastructure with proper security and data isolation

## Story List

| Story | Title | Status | Dependencies | Est. Days |
|-------|-------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **1.1** | [Project Setup and Development Environment](./1.1.project-setup.md) | Draft | None | 2-3 |
| **1.2** | [User Authentication System](./1.2.authentication-system.md) | Draft | 1.1 | 3-4 |
| **1.3** | [Database Schema and Core Models](./1.3.database-schema.md) | Draft | 1.1 | 3-4 |
| **1.4** | [Basic Peptide Management](./1.4.peptide-management.md) | Draft | 1.2, 1.3 | 4-5 |

**Total Estimated Duration:** 12-16 days

## Critical Path Analysis

### Sequential Path:
```
1.1 → 1.2 → 1.4 (Frontend functionality)
1.1 → 1.3 → 1.4 (Data functionality)
```

### Parallel Optimization:
- **Days 1-3:** Complete 1.1 (Project Setup)
- **Days 4-7:** Run 1.2 (Authentication) and 1.3 (Database) in parallel
- **Days 8-12:** Complete 1.4 (Peptide Management) using outputs from 1.2 and 1.3

**Optimized Duration with 2 developers:** 8-10 days

## Success Criteria

### Technical Foundation Complete:
- ✅ Next.js 14+ project with TypeScript operational
- ✅ Clerk.com authentication system functional
- ✅ Supabase PostgreSQL database with complete schema
- ✅ tRPC API layer connecting frontend to backend
- ✅ Basic peptide CRUD operations working

### User Capabilities Delivered:
- ✅ Users can register and authenticate securely
- ✅ Users can manage their personal peptide library
- ✅ Users can add custom peptides with dosing information
- ✅ Users can search and filter their peptides
- ✅ Users have access to pre-configured common peptides

### Infrastructure Ready for Epic 2:
- ✅ Authentication system supports protected injection logging
- ✅ Database schema supports injection tracking
- ✅ UI components ready for injection forms
- ✅ API patterns established for additional features

## Technical Architecture Summary

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14+ with React 18+ and TypeScript
- **Authentication:** Clerk.com with subscription billing
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
- **API:** tRPC for type-safe client-server communication
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS with Radix UI components
- **State:** Zustand for lightweight state management
- **Testing:** Vitest with Testing Library

### Security Implementation:
- HIPAA-adjacent health data protection
- Complete user data isolation via RLS policies
- Secure authentication with Clerk.com
- Environment-based configuration management

### Performance Targets:
- Page load time: < 2 seconds
- API response time: < 500ms
- Database query time: < 100ms

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items:
1. **External Service Dependencies**
   - Risk: Clerk.com or Supabase service setup issues
   - Mitigation: Clear setup documentation and fallback development options

2. **Authentication-Database Integration**
   - Risk: User ID mapping between Clerk and Supabase
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive integration testing and validation

3. **Type Safety Across Stack**
   - Risk: Type mismatches between frontend and backend
   - Mitigation: tRPC ensures end-to-end type safety

### Medium Risk Items:
1. **Development Environment Complexity**
   - Risk: Complex setup blocking development start
   - Mitigation: Detailed setup documentation and validation scripts

2. **Component Architecture Scalability**
   - Risk: Component patterns not supporting Epic 2-4 needs
   - Mitigation: Follow established design system patterns

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### External Account Setup Required:
- Clerk.com account with application configuration
- Supabase project with database access
- Vercel account for deployment (future)

### Development Environment:
- Node.js 18+ with npm/pnpm
- Git for version control
- VS Code or similar editor (recommended)

### Manual Setup Tasks:
- Create Clerk.com application and obtain API keys
- Create Supabase project and configure database
- Set up environment variables in .env.local

## Epic Completion Definition of Done

### All Stories Complete:
- [ ] 1.1: Project Setup - All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] 1.2: Authentication - User flows working end-to-end
- [ ] 1.3: Database Schema - All tables and relationships functional
- [ ] 1.4: Peptide Management - CRUD operations complete

### Integration Validation:
- [ ] End-to-end user flow: Registration → Login → Peptide Management
- [ ] Cross-user data isolation verified
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied

### Epic 2 Readiness:
- [ ] Injection logging can build on peptide management
- [ ] Authentication supports protected injection features
- [ ] Database ready for injection data storage
- [ ] UI patterns established for form interactions

## Next Epic Preparation

Epic 1 provides the foundation for Epic 2: Injection Logging & History Management by delivering:

- Authenticated users who can access protected features
- Peptide library for injection selection
- Database schema ready for injection data
- UI component patterns for forms and data display
- API patterns for CRUD operations

**Epic 1 Success = Epic 2 Development Ready** ✅
