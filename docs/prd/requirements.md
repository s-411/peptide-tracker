# Requirements

## Functional

1. **FR1:** The system shall provide a comprehensive peptide database allowing users to select from pre-configured peptides or add custom peptides with dosing information.

2. **FR2:** The system shall enable users to set up dosing schedules with daily/weekly dose targets (e.g., 2mg Semaglutide weekly) for tracking protocol adherence.

3. **FR3:** The system shall provide quick injection logging functionality capturing time, dose amount, injection site, and optional notes for each injection.

4. **FR4:** The system shall display weekly dose monitoring with visual progress tracking against weekly targets and alert users when approaching or exceeding dose limits.

5. **FR5:** The system shall maintain a comprehensive, filterable injection history table showing all logged injections with search and filtering capabilities by date, peptide, dose, and injection site.

6. **FR6:** The system shall provide a "Last 7 Days Summary" view showing recent dosing activity to help users track weekly protocol compliance.

7. **FR7:** The system shall enable users to export their complete injection history and data in standard formats (CSV, PDF).

8. **FR8:** The system shall support user account creation, authentication, and secure data management with password reset capabilities.

9. **FR9:** The system shall provide responsive web application functionality optimized for both desktop and mobile use with PWA capabilities for offline injection logging.

10. **FR10:** The system shall include Jay Campbell's expert content integration with peptide protocols, safety guidelines, and educational materials accessible within the tracking interface.

## Non Functional
