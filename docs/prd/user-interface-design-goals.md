# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The Peptide Tracker will embody a premium, expert-focused experience that combines the precision of professional health tracking with the accessibility needed for daily use. The interface will feel like a specialized tool built by and for peptide experts, emphasizing trust, accuracy, and efficiency. The design will convey Jay Campbell's credibility through subtle branding while maintaining a clean, data-driven aesthetic that appeals to the biohacker mindset.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Quick Logging First:** Primary user flow optimized for rapid injection entry within 30 seconds
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Advanced features accessible but not cluttering the core experience
- **Expert Guidance Integration:** Jay Campbell's protocols and recommendations contextually available
- **Data Visualization Focus:** Clear charts and progress indicators for weekly dose monitoring
- **Mobile-Optimized Interactions:** Touch-friendly inputs and swipe gestures for mobile logging

## Core Screens and Views

- **Dashboard:** Weekly dose progress, recent injections, quick logging access
- **Quick Log Injection:** Streamlined form for rapid injection entry
- **Injection History:** Comprehensive table with filtering, search, and export capabilities
- **Weekly Progress:** Visual tracking of dose targets with alerts and recommendations
- **Peptide Setup:** Configuration of peptides, schedules, and dose targets
- **Profile Settings:** Account management, preferences, and data export
- **Expert Content:** Jay Campbell's protocols, safety guidelines, and educational materials

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application will meet WCAG AA standards to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities, including proper color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and alternative text for visual elements.

## Branding

The design system implements a sophisticated dark theme with red primary color (#ff3427) that conveys energy and precision. Typography uses Antonio for headings (bold, impactful) and Poppins for body text (clean, readable). The aesthetic emphasizes premium quality and expert credibility while maintaining the approachable feel needed for daily health tracking. Subtle integration of Jay Campbell's branding elements reinforces the partnership without overwhelming the user experience.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on responsive web application optimized for both desktop and mobile usage, with PWA capabilities for native app-like experience on mobile devices. The application will adapt seamlessly across screen sizes from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
