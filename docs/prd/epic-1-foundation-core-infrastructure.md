# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

Establish the foundational technical infrastructure including project setup, user authentication, database schema, and basic peptide management capabilities. This epic will deliver a working application with user registration, login, and the ability to manage a personal peptide library, providing the foundation for all subsequent tracking features.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment

As a developer,
I want a properly configured Next.js project with all necessary dependencies and development tools,
so that the team can begin building features efficiently with consistent code quality.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Next.js 14+ project created with TypeScript configuration
2. Tailwind CSS integrated with custom design system tokens from colors.json and design-tokens.json
3. Database connection configured for PostgreSQL with proper environment variable management
4. ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality and consistency
5. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore and README documentation
6. Basic project structure established with clear separation between pages, components, and utilities
7. Development and production build scripts configured and tested

## Story 1.2: User Authentication System

As a potential user,
I want to create an account and securely log into the application,
so that I can access my personal peptide tracking data.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. User registration form with email, password, and basic profile information
2. Secure login functionality with email and password authentication
3. Password reset capability via email with secure token validation
4. User session management with proper authentication state handling
5. Protected routes that require authentication to access tracking features
6. Secure password hashing and storage following security best practices
7. Basic user profile management for updating account information

## Story 1.3: Database Schema and Core Models

As a developer,
I want well-structured database models for users, peptides, and injections,
so that the application can store and retrieve tracking data efficiently.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. User model with authentication fields, profile information, and timestamps
2. Peptide model supporting both pre-configured and custom peptides with dosing information
3. Injection model capturing dose, time, injection site, peptide reference, and notes
4. Database migrations and seed data for common peptides
5. Proper foreign key relationships and data integrity constraints
6. Database indexes optimized for common query patterns (user injections, date ranges)
7. Comprehensive data validation at the database level

## Story 1.4: Basic Peptide Management

As a user,
I want to manage my personal peptide library with pre-configured and custom peptides,
so that I can set up the peptides I use for injection tracking.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Peptide library interface displaying available peptides with dosing information
2. Add custom peptide functionality with name, typical dosing, and notes
3. Edit existing peptides in personal library with proper validation
4. Delete peptides from personal library with confirmation and dependency checking
5. Search and filter peptides by name or category
6. Pre-populated database with common peptides used by Jay Campbell's audience
7. Peptide details view showing dosing recommendations and usage notes
