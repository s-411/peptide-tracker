## Background Context

The peptide therapy market is experiencing rapid mainstream adoption, but users currently rely on inadequate tracking solutions like spreadsheets, basic health apps, or simple notes. Generic health apps like MyFitnessPal and Cronometer lack peptide-specific features such as injection site tracking, cycling protocols, and stacking management. No existing solutions provide AI-powered insights for peptide data optimization or expert-guided protocols.

This creates a massive opportunity for a purpose-built peptide tracking application that leverages Jay Campbell's credibility and engaged community for distribution. The solution will focus first on being the best peptide tracker with exceptional injection logging, weekly dose monitoring, and comprehensive history management, then expand to AI-powered optimization insights. The partnership with Jay Campbell provides instant trust, distribution, and access to a warm market of serious peptide users willing to pay premium prices for expert-backed solutions.
