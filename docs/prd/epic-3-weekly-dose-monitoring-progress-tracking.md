# Epic 3: Weekly Dose Monitoring & Progress Tracking

Add intelligent dose tracking and progress monitoring capabilities that help users stay on protocol and demonstrate clear value over basic logging solutions. This epic transforms the app from a simple logging tool into an intelligent tracking system that provides guidance and insights.

## Story 3.1: Dose Target Configuration

As a peptide user,
I want to set weekly and daily dose targets for my peptides,
so that I can track my adherence to prescribed or planned protocols.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Dose target setup interface for each peptide in user's library
2. Weekly dose target configuration (e.g., 2mg Semaglutide weekly)
3. Daily dose target option for peptides used on daily schedules
4. Flexible scheduling options (every other day, specific days of week)
5. Multiple active protocols support for peptide stacking
6. Start and end date configuration for cycling protocols
7. Protocol templates based on Jay Campbell's recommended schedules

## Story 3.2: Weekly Progress Dashboard

As a peptide user,
I want to see my current progress toward weekly dose targets,
so that I can ensure I'm staying on track with my protocols.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Weekly progress dashboard showing current week's dose accumulation
2. Visual progress bars or charts for each active peptide protocol
3. Percentage completion and remaining doses for the week
4. Days remaining in current week with suggested dosing schedule
5. Color-coded status indicators (on track, behind, ahead, complete)
6. Quick access to log additional doses directly from progress view
7. Historical weekly performance trends showing consistency over time

## Story 3.3: Dose Alerts and Recommendations

As a peptide user,
I want to receive intelligent alerts about my dosing schedule,
so that I can avoid missed doses and stay within safe limits.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Alert system for approaching weekly dose limits (e.g., 90% of target reached)
2. Missed dose notifications based on expected protocol timing
3. Overdose prevention alerts when attempting to exceed safe limits
4. Injection site rotation reminders to prevent tissue damage
5. Protocol completion notifications when weekly targets are met
6. Customizable alert preferences and delivery methods
7. Smart recommendations for optimal timing of remaining doses

## Story 3.4: Protocol Analytics and Insights

As a peptide user,
I want to see analytics about my protocol adherence and patterns,
so that I can optimize my peptide use and identify trends.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Protocol adherence statistics showing consistency over time
2. Injection site rotation analysis to ensure proper practices
3. Timing pattern analysis identifying optimal injection windows
4. Dose variance tracking to maintain consistent levels
5. Weekly summary reports showing key metrics and achievements
6. Month-over-month comparison of protocol compliance
7. Exportable analytics reports for sharing with healthcare providers
